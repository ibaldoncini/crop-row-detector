## Abstract

This study introduces a methodology for processing
high-resolution spatial images captured by unmanned aerial

vehicles (UAVs) with the goal of detecting crop rows in peri-
urban horticultural fields. The image processing approach is

unsupervised and solely relies on open-source tools. This ensures
that the procedure can be easily generalized and adapted to other
datasets with similar features. The article details the sources
and attributes of the data used, and outlines the algorithms
and concepts involved in the processing journey, culminating
in the creation of the final product. The process encompasses
the preprocessing of images, field segmentation into individual
plots, the rectification and cropping of each plot, and the

subsequent detection of crop rows within these plots. The pre-
sented methodology holds promise in automating and enhancing

the accuracy of crop row detection in horticultural settings,
thereby offering invaluable insights for agricultural planning and
decision-making.
